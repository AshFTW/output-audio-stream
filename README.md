## Known issues
0. PortAudio built-in monitor device of current output device have a big latency like 0.4 sec, maybe moar
0. PortAudio's monitor device have big latency

0. Very large PortAudio's monitor device latency

About the last issue: even microphone device latency over WiFi 5 is pretty damn good.

## Troubleshooting (LEGACY)
### Debian/Ubuntu:
Launch server, open "Volume Control", select tab named "Recording", locale something like "**ALSA plug-in [linux-audiowire-server]**: ALSA Capture *from*: " and select something like "Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo".
### Arch/Manjaro:
Launch "Audio Volume â€” System Settings Module", go to "Advanced". In second dropdown list named "Built-in Audio" set the same Profile as in first one.
